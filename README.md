# tremor.jepsen

This repository adds support to tremor for the Jepsen test harness
for clustered tremor. Currently, the source targets the RAFT consensus
layer of tremor which is under development.
ls 
The docker environment sets up a Jepsen console and 5 nodes for
conducting test runs.

## Prerequisites

All systems
- Ensure `docker` is installed
- Ensure `docker-compose` is installed

On Linux
- There are no known prerequisites apart from git and docker installations.

On Mac OS X
- `brew install bash`
  - so that the `docker/bin/up` and `docker/bin/console` scripts use a
    more up-to-date bash version ( required by Jepsen up script ).

## Usage

Jepsen tests for tremor

### Start Jepsen environment with 5 logical nodes

Start the docker test environment
```bash
./docker/bin/up --dev
```

### Once 5 nodes have started, run Jepsen test phase

```bash
./docker/bin/console
# make the node host keys known to the console machine
rm -rf ~/.ssh/known_hosts
for node in $(echo "n1 n2 n3 n4 n5"); do ssh -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no $node echo "alrighty"; done
# run the jepsen test, use --help to see all the available options
lein run test --rate 100 --concurrency 20 --time-limit 30

#or

lein run test --rate 100 --concurrency 10 --time-limit 30
```
